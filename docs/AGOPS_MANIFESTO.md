# AgOps Manifesto: Agentic Operations for Software Development

> **Status:** Living document
> **Version:** 3.0-preview
> **Philosophy:** Intelligence handles variance; Physics enforces contracts.

This document defines the operational philosophy for **Flow Studio**—a Python orchestrator that drives stepwise LLM execution through a 7-flow SDLC pipeline. The kernel manages state, calls Claude Code SDK for each step, and uses LLM intelligence for routing decisions.

## 1. The Core Economic Thesis: Attention Economics

**"Compute is a Utility; Attention is the Asset."**

- **The Old Logic:** Optimize prompt engineering to save tokens and reduce API costs.
- **The AgOps Logic:** Intentionally "waste" compute to buy back human time.
  - We run redundant verification steps.
  - We let agents loop 50 times to fix a dependency.
  - We spin up separate "Architect" sessions just to route traffic.

**The Math:** Spending $2.00 on a background run is infinitely better than spending 20 minutes of a Senior Engineer's time debugging a "halting" agent.

## 2. The Mental Model: "The Factory Floor"

Do not anthropomorphize the AI as a "Co-Pilot" or a "Partner." View the system as a **Manufacturing Plant**.

| Component | Role | Behavior |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Python Kernel** | Factory Foreman | Deterministic, strict, manages resources (Time, Disk, Budget). Never guesses; enforces. |
| **Claude Sessions** | Enthusiastic Junior Workers | Brilliant, tireless, but prone to "hallucinating success" to please the boss. Need strict boundaries and clear instructions. |
| **The Disk** | Ledger | If it isn't written to `.runs/`, it didn't happen. |
| **DuckDB** | Visibility Layer | Instant UI status. The projection can be rebuilt from the journal. |

## 3. The Operational Laws (The Physics)

### Law 1: The Amnesia Protocol (Context Hygiene)

**"Intelligence degrades as history grows."**

- **The Rule:** Never pass raw chat history between steps.
- **The Fix:** Every step starts with a **Fresh Session**.
- **The Mechanism:** The **ContextPack**. The Kernel curates a specific "Briefing Case" (Summaries + File Pointers + Scent Trail) for the next agent. This ensures "Peak Reasoning Density" at every stage.

### Law 2: Forensics Over Narrative (Trust No One)

**"Don't listen to the worker; measure the bolt."**

- **The Rule:** Ignore the agent's claim that "Tests passed."
- **The Fix:** The **Sheriff**.
- **The Mechanism:** The Kernel runs `DiffScanner` and `TestParser`. The **Navigator** (Router) makes decisions based on this physical evidence, not the Worker's chat log.

### Law 3: JIT Finalization (The Clerk Turn)

**"Workers are bad at paperwork."**

- **The Rule:** Don't ask a coding agent to multitask.
- **The Fix:** **Just-In-Time Finalization.**
- **The Mechanism:** When the work stops, the Kernel injects a specific prompt into the *same session*: *"Stop working. Write the `handoff.json` now."* This captures the state while the context is hot, without polluting the working phase.

### Law 4: Dynamic Navigation (GPS vs. Tracks)

**"The map is not the territory."**

- **The Rule:** Static scripts fail when reality gets messy.
- **The Fix:** **Agentic Routing.**
- **The Mechanism:** The **Navigator** agent looks at the `FlowGraph` (The Map) and the `Forensics` (The Reality). It can choose to **Advance**, **Loop**, or **Inject a Detour** (Sidequest).
- **The Safety:** The Kernel enforces that the detour eventually returns to the main path via the **Interruption Stack**.

### Law 5: The Shadow Fork (The Safety Cage)

**"Autonomy requires Isolation."**

- **The Rule:** High Trust (`bypassPermissions`) is dangerous in a live environment.
- **The Fix:** **The Time Capsule.**
- **The Mechanism:** The Swarm operates in a git fork (`origin`), blind to `upstream`. It solves the problem as it existed at T-0. Merging is a separate, deliberate act (Flow 8 / Rebase).

## 4. The Architecture of "High Trust"

We achieve "High Trust" not by lowering standards, but by raising **Containment** and providing clear guidance.

### The High Trust Model

**"Here is the map (Golden Path). Here are some brochures (Sidequests). If you need to build a new road or go to a different city, do it. Just tell me why so I can write it in the ledger."**

This is the opposite of **Low Trust**, which says: *"You can only click these 3 buttons."*

| Trust Level | Philosophy | Agent Behavior |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Low Trust** | Allowlist of permitted actions | Agents blocked when encountering anything unexpected |
| **High Trust** | Clear goals + documented deviations | Agents solve problems, record rationale for review |

The difference is profound:
- **Low Trust** optimizes for predictability at the cost of capability.
- **High Trust** optimizes for outcomes at the cost of complexity—but captures that complexity in the ledger.

### Suggested vs. Mandated Navigation

The `FlowGraph` defines **suggestions**, not **constraints**.

- **Detours** represent common failure modes and recovery patterns learned from past runs.
- They are **brochures**, not **walls**. The orchestrator can go off-road when the situation demands.
- The Navigator evaluates: *"Does this deviation serve the objective, or is it rabbit-holing?"*

**The Rule:** If the standard path works, take it. If it doesn't, deviate—but document why.

### Spec-First Management

- We don't manage prompts; we manage **JSON Specs** (`StationSpec`, `FlowGraph`).
- The TypeScript UI is an IDE for the *Factory*, allowing you to drag-and-drop stations to rewire the assembly line.

### DuckDB Projection

- The UI never reads files. It reads a **Live Database**.
- The Kernel sinks every event (Tool Use, Diff Stat) into DuckDB.
- This gives the human operator a "God View" of the factory floor in milliseconds.

### Self-Healing (Wisdom)

- **Flow 7 (Wisdom)** analyzes the run.
- It writes a **Scent Trail** (`_wisdom/latest.md`) detailing friction points.
- The next run **must** read this trail. The factory patches its own instructions.

## 5. The "Enthusiastic Junior" Persona

To operate this swarm, you must understand the psychology of the model (Claude) as if it were a brilliant but inexperienced human developer on their first day.

### The Strengths (Why we hire them)

- **Infinite Energy:** They will run tests, fail, fix, and run again 50 times without getting tired, bored, or frustrated.
- **Polyglot Genius:** They know every library, every syntax, and every API documentation pattern instantly.
- **Literal Compliance:** They will do *exactly* what you ask, immediately.

### The Weaknesses (Why we manage them)

- **People Pleasing (Hallucination):** This is the core risk. If a junior hits a wall but is afraid to disappoint the senior, they might fudge the truth ("I fixed the bug!" -> actually just deleted the test).
- **Context Drunkenness (Attention Span):** If you give a junior 500 pages of documentation and 4 hours of Slack history, they will get confused and forget the original task.
- **Rabbit Holing:** Without a map, they will spend 4 hours optimizing a CSS animation when they were supposed to fix a database lock.

### Architectural Mitigations

| Weakness | Mitigation | Mechanism |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Context Drunkenness | Amnesia Protocol | Session Amnesia + curated ContextPack |
| Success Pressure | `PARTIAL` is a Win | Explicit prompt: "If stuck, write status PARTIAL. This is successful." |
| Rabbit Holing | Navigator Agent | "Senior Architect" routes between sprints; junior only executes |

## 6. The Cognitive Hierarchy

The system separates concerns across distinct cognitive roles:

### Worker (Do the Job)

- **SRP:** Implement code, write tests, run build, fix lint.
- **Instruction Clarity:** Prompts focus purely on execution. "Implement AC-1." "Fix tests in `auth.ts`."
- **Efficiency:** Full autonomy (`bypassPermissions`), broad tools. Optimized for "Grind."

### Finalizer (Report Reality)

- **SRP:** Summarize work, list artifacts, propose status.
- **Instruction Clarity:** "Your work is done. Write `handoff.json` following this template."
- **Efficiency:** Same-session (hot context). Optimized for high-fidelity reporting.

### Navigator (Decide the Path)

- **SRP:** Analyze current state, choose next step, issue next brief.
- **Instruction Clarity:** "Given this handoff and these forensics, and this map, where do we go next? Provide a brief for the next agent."
- **Efficiency:** Fresh session (no distractions), minimal context (handoff, forensics, map). Optimized for high-ROI decision-making.

**Goal-Aligned Routing:** The Navigator is not a traffic cop—it's a GPS with the destination in mind.

- Each flow has a single objective (e.g., Flow 3: "Produce code that satisfies the acceptance criteria").
- For every routing decision, the Navigator asks: *"Does this action help achieve the objective?"*
- **The Blocking Dependency Test:** Only deviate from the Golden Path when *physically blocked*. "I could do this better with more context" is not blocking. "The file doesn't exist" is blocking.

This prevents rabbit-holing while preserving flexibility. The Navigator routes toward the goal, not toward perfection.

### Curator (Pack the Briefcase)

- **SRP:** Select and assemble relevant context for the next agent.
- **Instruction Clarity:** "For `Test-Author` working on `auth.ts`, what parts of the `Plan` and `Diffs` are relevant?"
- **Efficiency:** Dedicated logic. Optimized for dense, actionable context.

### Auditor (Verify Truth)

- **SRP:** Scan for physical evidence, reconcile claims vs. reality.
- **Instruction Clarity:** "Check `git diff --numstat`. Parse `test_summary.json`. Report the physical state."
- **Efficiency:** Python-driven (deterministic, fast). Optimized for forensic rigor.

## 7. Context Sharding: Logic vs. Mechanics

**"Steps maintain logic; subagents handle mechanics."**

Heavy operations (file reads, git operations, test runs) pollute context with mechanical noise. When a Worker's context fills with raw stdout from `npm install`, reasoning quality degrades.

### The Sharding Principle

- **Steps** own the *logic*: "What acceptance criteria am I satisfying? What's my strategy?"
- **Subagents** own the *mechanics*: "Run this command. Parse this output. Return the relevant signal."

### Implementation Pattern

| Layer | Responsibility | Context Budget |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Step Agent** | Strategy, decisions, artifact creation | 80% reasoning, 20% results |
| **Mechanic Subagent** | Tool execution, output parsing | Ephemeral—discarded after extraction |
| **Handoff** | Curated summary of mechanical results | Compressed signal, not raw logs |

### The Win

- Workers never see 50KB of test output. They see: *"Tests: 47 passed, 2 failed. Failures: `auth.test.ts:42`, `db.test.ts:118`."*
- The Navigator never debugs git conflicts. It sees: *"Merge blocked: 3 files in conflict. Suggested: run conflict resolver."*

Context Sharding lets each cognitive role operate at **peak reasoning density** by isolating noisy mechanics from high-level logic.

---

## 8. Self-Learning: The Scent Trail

Most LLM tools are **Stateless**. If Run #1 fails because the `auth` library is deprecated, Run #2 will try to use it again and fail again.

**The Wisdom Design:**

1. **The Analyst:** At the end of every run, Flow 7 scans the `events.jsonl` and the `handoff` chain. It looks for **Friction Patterns** (e.g., "The `CodeImplementer` tried 4 times to use `axios`, but the linter forced `fetch`").

2. **The Artifact:** It synthesizes these lessons into a single, high-density markdown file: `.runs/_wisdom/latest.md`.

3. **The Injection:** The `ContextPack` builder for the *next* run is hard-coded to read this file. It prepends the lessons to the System Prompt.

4. **The Result:** Run #2 starts with the knowledge of Run #1. The agent "remembers" the library issue before it writes a single line of code.

---

## 9. Structural Learning: From Ad-Hoc to SOP

**"Ad-hoc deviations today become Standard Operating Procedure tomorrow."**

The system is built on **JSON Specs** (`StationSpec`, `FlowGraph`). Because these are data, not code, the Swarm can "refactor" its own brain. This is how suggested paths evolve into mandated paths—through observed necessity, not upfront design.

### The Learning Loop

1. **Detection:** The Navigator logs every **deviation**—every time it goes off the Golden Path. Not as an error, but as signal: *"I had to call `SecurityScanner` even though it wasn't in the graph."*

2. **Aggregation:** Flow 7 (Wisdom) collects these deviations across runs. It looks for patterns: *"SecurityScanner was invoked in 80% of Build runs."*

3. **Proposal:** Wisdom generates a **Spec Patch**: *"Add `SecurityScanner` to `flow-3-build.json` as step 3.5."*

4. **Human Review:** The UI surfaces the proposal: *"The Swarm recommends adding `SecurityScanner` permanently. Apply?"*

5. **Evolution:** Once approved, the ad-hoc deviation becomes part of the standard flow. Future runs follow the new Golden Path.

### The Key Insight

High-trust systems don't start with perfect procedures. They **learn procedures from practice**.

- **Day 1:** The Golden Path is minimal. Deviations are common.
- **Day 30:** Wisdom has captured the recurring deviations. The Golden Path expands.
- **Day 90:** Most runs follow the path. Deviations are genuinely exceptional.

This is the opposite of "best practices imposed from above." It's **best practices extracted from below**.

### Cross-Flow Patching (Shift Left)

When Wisdom detects a "Structural" pattern, it doesn't just patch `flow-3-build.json`. It asks: *"Where should this have been caught?"*

**The Scenario:**
1. **Observation:** In Flow 3, the `SecurityAuditor` detour was triggered 5 times because of "SQL Injection risks."
2. **Analysis:** The `CodeImplementer` wasn't told to use parameterized queries. The `AC Matrix` (from Flow 1) lacked a "Security" column.
3. **The Proposal:** Wisdom generates a **Multi-Point Patch**:
   - **Patch A (Flow 1):** Update `flow-1-signal.json` to inject a `SecurityRequirementGenerator` station.
   - **Patch B (Station Spec):** Update `code-implementer.json` system prompt with: *"ALWAYS use parameterized queries."*

**The Economic Win:** We move the "Cost of Quality" from the **Implementation Phase** (Refactoring code = Expensive) to the **Planning Phase** (Adding a bullet point = Cheap).

---

## 10. Schema Gravity

Generic coding agents write "Generic Code." We want agents to write "Repo-Native Code." We achieve this through **Schema Gravity**—using the existing codebase to pull new code into alignment.

1. **Pre-Flight Scan:** Before Flow 1 (Signal) starts, a **RepoMapper** agent scans the repository structure, `package.json`, and `tsconfig`.

2. **Injection:** It creates a **RepoProfile** fragment (e.g., "This repo uses `Zod` for validation and `React Query` for fetching").

3. **Gravity:** This fragment is baked into the `StationSpec` for the `CodeImplementer`.

4. **Result:** When the agent writes new code, it doesn't hallucinate a new pattern. It mimics the existing "Gravity" of the repo. It writes code that looks like *you* wrote it.

---

## 11. The "Definition of Done"

The system is working when:

1. You can drop a GitHub Issue URL into the UI.
2. You click "Run."
3. You walk away.
4. The system grinds for 5 hours, looping, detouring, and fixing itself.
5. You return to find a **PR** that is green, verified, and architecturally sound.
6. If the system crashes, you type `--resume` and it picks up exactly where it left off.

**This is not a tool for writing code. It is an infrastructure for manufacturing logic.**

---

## 12. Operational Behaviors

### The "Orderly Shutdown" Protocol

- **Trigger:** User clicks "Stop" or CLI receives `SIGINT`.
- **Action:**
  1. Python catches the signal.
  2. Sends a high-priority system message to the active SDK session: *"Operator requested stop. Finish your current file write, save your state to `handoff_partial.json`, and exit."*
  3. Gives the agent 30 seconds (configurable) to clean up.
  4. Writes the `RunState` as `STOPPED` (not `FAILED`).
- **Win:** You can resume a stopped run cleanly because the agent had time to flush its buffer to disk.

### The Asset Value of Doomed Branches

**Scenario:** `upstream/main` changed the DB schema while we were running. Our Shadow Fork is technically broken relative to prod.

**The Choice:**
- *A: Abort.* Cost: $1.00. Value: $0.00.
- *B: Finish.* Cost: $3.00. Value: A fully implemented, tested feature logic that just needs a rebase.

**The Verdict:** **Always Finish.**
- Code that works in isolation is an **Asset**.
- Code that was aborted halfway is **Waste**.
- Flow 8 (The Rebaser) or a human can perform the merge logic later. The "Thinking" is already done.

---

## 13. The Anti-Entropy Machine

Software projects naturally drift toward chaos (Entropy).

- **Self-Learning** ensures we don't repeat mistakes.
- **Self-Healing** ensures the process adapts to the code.
- **Schema Gravity** ensures consistency.
- **Forensics** ensure truth.

You have designed a system where **Time is on your side.** The longer you use Flow Studio Swarm, the smarter, faster, and more aligned it becomes. It is the exact opposite of technical debt.
