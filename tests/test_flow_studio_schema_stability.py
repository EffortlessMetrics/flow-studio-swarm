"""
OpenAPI Schema Stability Tests for Flow Studio FastAPI backend.

These tests detect breaking changes to the API contract by comparing the live
schema against a committed baseline (`docs/flowstudio-openapi.json`).

## Purpose

- Prevent accidental removal of endpoints or HTTP methods
- Detect changes to OpenAPI version or API version
- Track schema evolution over time
- Enable safe API refactoring with confidence

## Usage

Run these tests during development to detect schema changes:

```bash
make validate-openapi-schema
```

Or run specific stability checks:

```bash
pytest tests/test_flow_studio_schema_stability.py -v
```

## Baseline Management

To update the baseline schema after intentional API changes:

```bash
make dump-openapi-schema
git add docs/flowstudio-openapi.json
git commit -m "Update OpenAPI schema baseline"
```

## Test Philosophy

- **Endpoints can be added** (additive changes are safe)
- **Endpoints should not be removed** (breaking change)
- **HTTP methods should not be removed from endpoints** (breaking change)
- **API version should only increase** (semver progression)
- **OpenAPI spec version should remain stable** (3.x family)

These tests implement "ratchet semantics": the schema can only grow or evolve
forward, never regress.
