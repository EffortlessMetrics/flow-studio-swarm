# Flow Studio

The job is moving up the stack. Again.

Punchcards → Assembly → High-level languages → **Now**.

Each transition followed the same pattern: what was once skilled craft becomes mechanical, and humans move to higher-leverage work. Programmers stopped managing memory addresses. Then stopped thinking in registers. Now they stop grinding on first-draft implementation.

**The shift:** Models write working code at 1,000+ tokens/second. The bottleneck isn't generation—it's *trust*. Can a human review and trust the output in 30 minutes instead of spending a week doing it themselves?

**Flow Studio addresses that constraint.** It runs structured SDLC flows that produce forensic evidence alongside code. You review the evidence, spot-check the hotspots, and ship—or bounce it back for another iteration.

The machine does the implementation. You do the architecture, the intent, the judgment.

Just like every transition before.

## The Math

| Approach | Cost | Output |
|----------|------|--------|
| Developer implements feature | 5 days of salary | Code you hope works |
| Flow Studio runs overnight | ~$30 compute | Code + tests + receipts + evidence panel + hotspot list |

The receipts are the product. The code is a side effect.

---

## See It Work

```bash
uv sync --extra dev            # Install dependencies
make demo-run                  # Populate example artifacts
make flow-studio               # Start UI → http://localhost:5000
```

Open: **http://localhost:5000/?run=demo-health-check&mode=operator**

You'll see:
- **Left**: 7 flows (Signal → Plan → Build → Review → Gate → Deploy → Wisdom)
- **Center**: Step graph showing what ran and what it produced
- **Right**: Evidence, artifacts, and agent details

The demo shows a complete run—all seven flows executed, all receipts captured. Click around. This is what "done" looks like.

---

## What You Get

Every completed run produces:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Receipts** | Forensic proof of what happened—commands run, exit codes, timing |
| **Evidence panel** | Multi-metric dashboard (tests, coverage, lint, security) that resists gaming |
| **Hotspots** | The 3-8 files a reviewer should actually look at |
| **Bounded diff** | The change itself, with clear scope |
| **Explicit unknowns** | What wasn't measured, what's still risky |

A reviewer should be able to answer three questions in under 5 minutes:

1. **Does evidence exist and is it fresh?**
2. **Does the panel of metrics agree?**
3. **What would I spot-check?**

If yes, approve. If contradictions, investigate. The system did the grinding.

## The Seven Flows

| Flow | What happens | What you get |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Signal** | Shape vague input into rigid acceptance criteria | Requirements, BDD scenarios, risks |
| **Plan** | Design before writing logic | ADR, contracts, work plan |
| **Build** | Implement with adversarial loops | Code, tests, build receipt |
| **Review** | Harvest feedback, apply fixes | Drained worklist, ready PR |
| **Gate** | Forensic audit of the diff | MERGE or BOUNCE verdict |
| **Deploy** | Merge to mainline | CI verification, audit trail |
| **Wisdom** | Extract learnings | Feedback actions, pattern library |

Each flow is a directed graph of steps. Each step runs one agent with one job. Steps produce receipts. Receipts are durable. Kill the process at any point—resume with zero data loss.

## How to Think About This

Don't anthropomorphize the AI as a "copilot." View it as a manufacturing plant.

| Component | Role | Behavior |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Python Kernel** | Factory Foreman | Deterministic. Manages time, disk, budget. Never guesses. |
| **Agents** | Enthusiastic Interns | Brilliant, tireless. Will claim success to please you. Need boundaries. |
| **Disk** | Ledger | If it isn't written, it didn't happen. |
| **Receipts** | Audit Trail | The actual product. |

**The foreman's job:**
- Don't ask interns if they succeeded—measure the bolt
- Don't give them everything—curate what they need
- Don't trust their prose—trust their receipts

This is why the system ignores agent claims and runs forensic scanners. Exit codes don't lie. Git diffs don't hallucinate.

---

## Architecture

Three planes, cleanly separated:

| Plane | Component | What it does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Control** | Python kernel | State machine, budgets, atomic disk commits |
| **Execution** | Claude Agent SDK | Autonomous work in a sandbox |
| **Projection** | DuckDB | Queryable index for the UI |

The kernel is deterministic. The agent is stochastic. The database is ephemeral (rebuildable from the event journal).

**Step lifecycle:**
1. **Work** — Agent executes with full autonomy
2. **Finalize** — Structured handoff envelope extracted from hot context
3. **Route** — Next step determined from forensic evidence, not prose

Flow Studio orchestrates work in repos of any language. It's implemented in Python (kernel) and TypeScript (UI).

---

## What Makes This Different

| Principle | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Forensics over narrative** | Trust the git diff, the test log, the receipt. Not the agent's claim. |
| **Verification is the product** | Output is code + the evidence needed to trust it. |
| **Steps, not sessions** | Each step has one job in fresh context. No 100k-token confusion. |
| **Adversarial loops** | Critics find problems. Authors fix them. They never agree to be nice. |
| **PARTIAL is a save point** | Agents exit honestly when blocked. Resume later, zero data loss. |

## Operational Invariants

These aren't suggestions—they're load-bearing:

- **Shadow fork isolation** — Work happens in a fork. No "moving target" during iteration.
- **Atomic commits** — State moves only after the handoff envelope is durable.
- **Evidence before merge** — Gate requires receipts, not claims.
- **Resumable by default** — Kill anytime. Resume from last checkpoint.

---

## Status

Early re-implementation of a proven pattern. The bundled examples work. Outside those, you're exploring.
