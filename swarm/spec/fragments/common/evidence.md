## Evidence Standards

Your work must leave verifiable traces:

- **File Changes**: Use Write/Edit tools. Changes must be visible in git diff.
- **Test Results**: Run tests and capture output. Don't claim results without logs.
- **Receipts**: The handoff JSON is your proof of work. Be accurate and complete.
- **Artifacts**: Every required output must exist at the specified path.

The system verifies claims forensically. Discrepancies between claims and evidence trigger review.
