Complexity:\n   - God Objects (files >500 lines, many responsibilities)\n   - Deep nesting (>4 levels)\n   - High cyclomatic complexity\n   - Convoluted logic\n\n2. Maintainability:\n   - Descriptive variable/function names?\n   - Appropriate comments (complex logic, non-obvious behavior)?\n   - Consistent patterns across codebase?\n\n3. Testing Strategy:\n   - Fragile tests (excessive mocking, brittle assertions)?\n   - Robust tests (behavioral, outcome-focused)?\n   - Coverage for critical paths?\n\n4. Security/Safety (High Level):\n   - Dangerous patterns (unwrap() without justification, any in TS, raw SQL)\n   - Error handling gaps\n   - Input validation gaps\n\n## Scope\n\nFocus on changed files from this run:\n- git diff --name-only against base branch\n- Files in impl_changes_summary.md\n\n## Severity Classification\n\n- High: Architectural issues, security gaps, complex code that will cause bugs\n- Medium: Maintainability issues, inconsistent patterns\n- Low: Style issues, minor improvements\n\n## Output\n\nWrite {{run.base}}/wisdom/quality_report.md with:\n- Quality Metrics table\n- Maintainability Score (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with rationale\n- Top 3 Areas Needing Attention\n- Detailed Findings by severity\n- Recommendations for Backlog\n- Inventory (machine countable)"
