Recurring Regressions (from regression_report.md):\n   - Same test failing repeatedly?\n   - Same file/module causing issues?\n   - Same type of regression?\n\n2. Repeated Code Quality Issues (from quality_report.md, code_critique.md):\n   - Same areas flagged for complexity?\n   - Persistent architectural issues?\n\n3. Review Patterns (from review_worklist.md):\n   - Same feedback types recurring?\n   - Same files getting flagged?\n\n4. Gate Outcomes (from merge_decision.md):\n   - Frequent bounces? From which flow?\n   - Common blocker types?\n\n5. Learning Echoes (from learnings.md):\n   - Same lessons 'learned' repeatedly?\n   - Feedback actions that keep getting suggested?\n\n## Pattern Criteria\n\n- Frequency: Same issue in 3+ runs\n- Recency: Last 5 runs more relevant than old ones\n- Severity: Focus on CRITICAL/MAJOR, not MINOR noise\n- Location: Files/modules that appear repeatedly\n\n## Pattern Assessment\n\nFor each pattern:\n- Impact: How much does this slow us down?\n- Root cause hypothesis: Why does this keep happening?\n- Actionability: Can we prevent this systematically?\n\n## Output\n\nWrite {{run.base}}/wisdom/pattern_report.md with:\n- Runs Analyzed table\n- High-Impact Patterns (PAT-NNN markers)\n- Recurring Regressions table\n- Recurring Quality Issues table\n- Learnings That Keep Repeating\n- Recommendations (systemic fixes, process changes)\n- Metrics and Inventory (PATTERN_HIGH_IMPACT, etc.)"
