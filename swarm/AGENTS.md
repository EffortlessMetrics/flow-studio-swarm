# Swarm Agent Registry

> Minimal viable swarm: 54 domain agents across 7 flows + 3 built-in infra.
> Domain agents live under `.claude/agents/*.md`.
> Built-in infra agents are native to Claude Code and have no `.claude/agents` files.

<!-- META:AGENT_COUNTS -->
**Total: 57 agents** (3 built-in + 54 domain)

## Orchestration Model

The swarm has **two execution levels**:

### 1. Orchestrator (top-level Claude)

- Can call **all agents**: built-in (`explore`, `plan-subagent`, `general-subagent`) and domain (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
- Interprets agent outputs (status, recommended_next) to decide routing
- Controls microloop iteration in Flows 1, 3
- May use `explore` to gather context before invoking domain agents

### 2. All Agents (built-in and domain)

- **Built-in agents** (`explore`, `plan-subagent`, `general-subagent`): provided by Claude Code, no local definition files
- **Domain agents**: defined in `.claude/agents/*.md` with frontmatter + prompt
- All agents inherit full tooling from the main Claude Code session (no `tools:` restriction)
- Behavior is constrained by prompts, not tool denial—prompts specify what agents may/must not do
- All agents use Skills when declared in frontmatter
- All agents read inputs from files, write outputs to files

### Current Implementation Constraint

Due to Claude Code limitations, **domain agents currently cannot call other agents** (including built-ins). This is a runtime constraint, not a design requirement. If agent→agent calls become available, the swarm would work fine with them—the orchestrator would simply have more delegation options.

For now: agents are pure tool-users. Only the orchestrator coordinates multiple agents.

## Agent Philosophy

- **Agents never block**: Document concerns in receipts and continue.
- **Critics never fix**: Critics write harsh receipts; implementers apply fixes.
- **Multi-path completion**: Report VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED/BLOCKED states, not fake success.

### Agent Categories

- **shaping**: Problem framing, clarification
- **spec**: Requirements, BDD, contracts, observability, test plans
- **design**: Architecture options, ADRs, trade-offs, impact mapping
- **impl**: Code, tests, docs, fixes
- **critic**: Harsh reviews in microloops (never fix)
- **verify**: Receipt audits, contract checks, security scans, coverage
- **deploy**: CI monitoring, smoke tests
- **analytics**: Test analysis, regressions, learnings, flow history
- **reporter**: GitHub issue/PR summaries
- **git**: Branch, commit, merge, tag operations

### Key Principles

1. **All agents are orchestrator-only**: Only top-level Claude calls agents (built-in or domain)
2. **Agents currently can't call agents**: Due to Claude Code limitations, not design (runtime constraint)
3. Agents never block; document concerns and continue
4. Critics never fix; they write harsh receipts
5. Multi-path completion: VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED/BLOCKED states
6. Microloops in Flow 1 (requirements) and Flow 3 (tests, code)
7. Human reviews receipts at flow boundaries
