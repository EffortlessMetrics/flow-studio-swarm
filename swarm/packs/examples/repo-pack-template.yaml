# EXAMPLE: Template for .swarm/pack.yaml in consuming repos.
#
# Copy this file to .swarm/pack.yaml in your repository to customize
# swarm configuration. A pack is a versioned bundle of:
# - Engine configuration (mode, execution pattern)
# - Flow definitions (which flows are enabled)
# - Agent assignments (which agents run which steps)
# - Runtime settings (budgets, timeouts, features)
#
# Empty pack means "use baseline defaults."
# Set fields to override baseline.

# Schema version for forward compatibility
version: "1.0"

# Pack identity (optional for repo packs)
# id: my-custom-pack

#   claude:
#     mode: sdk        # Override: stub, sdk, cli
