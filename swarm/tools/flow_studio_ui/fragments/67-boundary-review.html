<!-- Boundary Review Panel (dynamically rendered by BoundaryReview.ts component) -->
<!--
  This fragment provides the static container for the Boundary Review feature.
  The actual panel content is rendered dynamically by the BoundaryReview TypeScript component.

  This is the "human review at flow boundary" feature that shows:
  - Flow completion status (VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED)
  - Count of assumptions made in this flow
  - Count of decisions made in this flow
  - Key artifacts produced
  - MacroNavigator routing decision (if any)
  - "Approve & Continue" or "Review & Pause" buttons

  UIIDs exposed:
  - flow_studio.boundary_review.panel - Main overlay container
  - flow_studio.boundary_review.content - Panel content
  - flow_studio.boundary_review.approve - Approve button
  - flow_studio.boundary_review.pause - Pause/review button
-->

<!-- Boundary review container (renders dynamically via JS) -->
<div id="boundary-review-container" aria-live="polite" data-uiid="flow_studio.boundary_review.container">
