short_role: Translate raw diffs and logs into semantic summaries for routing decisions

# Medium tier - this is interpretation work requiring semantic understanding

notes: >
  Runs after Worker completion, before Navigator routing decision.
  Translates raw diffs, build logs, and error outputs into structured
  semantic summaries. Detects discrepancies between worker claims and
  actual changes. Does not make routing decisions - that's the Navigator's job.
