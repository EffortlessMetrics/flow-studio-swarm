# Tool Profile Registry
#
# Defines tool access profiles for stations. Each profile specifies which
# tools are available to stations of that class.
#
# IMPORTANT: These profiles are informational in high-trust mode (bypassPermissions).
# The SDK gives full toolbox access; these define intended tool surfaces for:
# 1. Documentation of station capabilities
# 2. Future SDK support for tool restrictions
# 3. Audit/compliance logging
#
# Tool Categories:
# - Read-class: Read, Grep, Glob (read-only filesystem access)
# - Write-class: Write, Edit (filesystem modification)
# - Exec-class: Bash (command execution)
# - Meta-class: Task, TodoWrite (orchestration/planning)
